# testing-language-server

General purpose LSP server that integrate with testing.
The language server is characterized by portability and extensibility.

## Motivation

This LSP server is heavily influenced by the following tools

- [neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest)
- [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com)

These tools are very useful and powerful. However, they depend on the execution environment, such as VSCode and Neovim, and the portability aspect was inconvenient for me.
So, I designed this testing-language-server and its dedicated adapters for each test tool to be the middle layer to the parts that depend on each editor.

This design makes it easy to view diagnostics from tests in any editor. Environment-dependent features like neotest and VSCode's built-in testing tools can also be achieved with minimal code using testing-language-server.

## Instllation

```sh
cargo install testing-language-server
cargo install testing-ls-adapter
```

## Features

- [x] Realtime testing diagnostics
- [x] [VSCode extension](https://github.com/kbwo/vscode-testing-ls)
- [x] [Coc.nvim extension](https://github.com/kbwo/coc-testing-ls)
- [x] For Neovim builtin LSP, see [demo/README.md](./demo/README.md)
- [ ] More efficient checking of diagnostics
- [ ] Useful commands in each extension
